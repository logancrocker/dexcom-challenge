# dexcom-challenge
code challenge for Dexcom

## Test 1
### Must have python Python selenium and webdriver manager libraries
cd test1
python test.py

## Test 2
### I was not able to devise a working solution with Python, but I provided what I believe to be a detailed walkthrough of the HTTP requests made when executing the manual steps, since this was offered as an alternative for Test 2.
### This is found in steps.txt
