# dexcom-challenge
### These are my solutions to the Dexcom code challenge.

## Test 1
### Must have python Python's selenium and webdriver-manager libraries.
```
cd test1
python test.py
```

## Test 2
### I was not able to come up with a working solution with Python requests, but I provided what I believe to be a detailed walkthrough of the HTTP requests made when executing the manual steps, since this was offered as an alternative for Test 2.
### This is found in steps.txt.
